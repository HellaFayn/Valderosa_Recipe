            <h2>Procedure:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Marinate the Chicken: In a large bowl or container, combine the chicken pieces with the soy sauce, minced garlic, sliced onion, bay leaves, and whole black peppercorns. 
                    Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. 
                    Cover the bowl or container and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, 
                    or overnight for best results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sear the Chicken: Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. 
                    Once the oil is hot, remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade for later) 
                    and sear the chicken pieces until they are golden brown on all sides. 
                    This step helps to lock in the flavors and adds depth to the dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simmer with Marinade: Once the chicken is seared, pour the remaining marinade over the chicken in 
                    the skillet or pot. Add the white vinegar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, 
                    then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, covered, for about 30 to 40 minutes, 
                    or until the chicken is tender and fully cooked. Stir occasionally to ensure the 
                    chicken is evenly coated with the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adjust Seasoning: Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt, if needed.
                    Remember that soy sauce is already salty, so adjust accordingly. 
                    You can also add more vinegar for a tangier flavor or more water if the sauce 
                    is too intense.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve: Once the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly, 
                    remove the bay leaves from the pot. Serve the chicken adobo hot with steamed rice, 
                    spooning the flavorful sauce over the chicken and rice. Garnish with chopped green 
                    onions or cilantro, if desired, for a fresh burst of flavor and color.
                </li>
