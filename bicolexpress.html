            <h2>Procedure:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Prepare the Pork Belly: Heat cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced pork belly and cook until lightly browned and crispy. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sauté Aromatics: In the same pan, sauté the minced garlic, chopped onion, and julienned ginger until fragrant and translucent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Incorporate Shrimp Paste: Add the shrimp paste (bagoong) to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring continuously to distribute the flavors evenly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Coconut Milk: Pour the coconut milk into the pan and stir to combine with the aromatics and shrimp paste. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simmer Pork: Return the cooked pork belly to the pan, stirring to coat it with the coconut milk mixture. Let the pork simmer in the coconut milk for about 15-20 minutes, or until it becomes tender and absorbs the flavors of the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add Chili Peppers: Add the chopped red chili peppers to the pan, adjusting the quantity according to your preferred level of spiciness. Stir well to incorporate the chili peppers into the sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season to Taste: Taste the Bicol Express and season with salt and ground black pepper as needed. Remember that shrimp paste is already salty, so adjust the seasoning accordingly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve Hot: Once the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened to your liking, remove the pan from the heat. Transfer the Bicol Express to a serving dish and serve hot with steamed rice.
